# @cloudflight/angular-display/lax

Secondary entry point of `@cloudflight/angular-display`. It can be used by importing from `@cloudflight/angular-display/lax`.

It provides the whole library in a non-typesafe way. Meaning you do not get any compile errors when using undefined breakpoints.
But you also do not need to extend the Breakpoints type in the ClfIsDisplay namespace, simplifying the setup of the library.
